                <p class="fw-bold">I'm a convinced GNU/Linux user</p>
                <p>
                   The open-source nature of Linux grants me unparalleled control
                   over my computing environment. The flexibility to customize every aspect, coupled
                   with a robust command line interface, enhances efficiency and technical proficiency. Contrary to
                   misconceptions, Linux offers a rich ecosystem of software, and its supportive community ensures
                   that assistance is readily available. In choosing Linux, I embrace a philosophy that goes beyond
                   mere software selection, reflecting a commitment to openness, collaboration, and a user-centric
                   computing experience.

                <p class="fw-bold">I value freedom above money</p>
                <p>
                  In my professional journey, I wholeheartedly embrace the principle of "freedom above all," prioritizing
                  personal connections and meaningful interactions over the conventional path of working for large corporations.
                  For me, the essence lies in one-on-one engagements, fostering genuine relationships with clients that extend
                  beyond the confines of corporate structures. This choice is driven by a desire for flexibility, allowing me to
                  dedicate my time and energy solely to projects that resonate with my interests and passions. It's a conscious
                  decision to eschew the allure of financial compensation in favor of the immeasurable value derived from the
                  comfort and authenticity of direct interactions with clients. By charting my own course, I reclaim control over
                  my work, ensuring that each project is a labor of love rather than a mere transaction. This commitment to personal
                  freedom not only defines my professional ethos but also imbues every project with a sense of purpose, making the
                  journey as rewarding as the destination.
                </p>
                <p class="fw-bold">Conclusion</p>
                <p>
                  Prioritizing freedom above monetary gains is a conscious decision to reclaim autonomy,
                  valuing the intrinsic satisfaction derived from meaningful interactions and projects over financial compensation.
                  In this regards, a common thread emerges: a dedication to ideals that extend beyond conventional
                  expectations, weaving together a narrative of empowerment, purpose, and a relentless pursuit of knowledge.

                <p class="fw-bold">I prioritizes minimal tech stack</p>
                <p>
                  As a full-stack web developer, I have wholeheartedly embraced a minimalist tech stack that
                  prioritizes simplicity, efficiency, and control over the often overwhelming array of options available.
                  Central to my approach is Python with Flask, a lightweight web framework that eschews unnecessary complexity,
                  allowing me to build web applications swiftly and maintainably. Complementing this, I rely on Bootstrap 5 for
                  front-end development, appreciating its responsive design and ease of use. Embracing a philosophy of avoiding
                  unnecessary entanglements with programming languages and frameworks, I leverage jQuery for its concise syntax
                  and versatility in enhancing user interactions. When speed and efficiency are paramount, I turn to plain Golang,
                  particularly for developing fast Terminal User Interface (TUI) applications. This approach, characterized by a
                  refusal to be bound by the dictates of programming languages and frameworks, represents a conscious decision to
                  wield technology rather than being wielded by it. By adhering to a minimalist tech stack, I prioritize clarity,
                  maintainability, and a focus on the essentials, ensuring that my development process remains a mindful and
                  intentional pursuit.

                <p class="fw-bold">I emphasize didactics in tutorials</p>
                <p>
                  Dedicating oneself to the didactic approach in tutorial creation demands a profound commitment to sacrificing
                  expediency, brevity, and personal ego in the pursuit of fostering thorough comprehension. This unwavering dedication
                  involves eschewing the temptation of oversimplification, opting instead for a deliberate exploration of intricate
                  subject matter. The sacrifice of time becomes evident as the tutor invests in crafting in-depth content that transcends
                  the superficial, providing learners with a reservoir of knowledge. Choosing didactic excellence over the allure of
                  superficial popularity, the tutor understands that the goal is not fleeting acclaim but a lasting impact on understanding.
                  Furthermore, the didactic approach requires a humbling sacrifice of personal ego, acknowledging that the learning journey
                  is a collaborative experience where mistakes are admitted, and the tutor walks alongside the learner.
                  This comprehensive commitment ensures that the tutorial becomes a cornerstone of enduring knowledge rather
                  than a transitory engagement, enriching learners with a deep and lasting understanding.
