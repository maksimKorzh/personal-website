                <p>
                  I'm Maksim Korzh aka Code Monkey King, an independent freelancer and blogger.
                  This is my personal visit card website intended to showcase what I've been up with through the years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Back in the day, in about 2018, I've started my first YouTube channel called
                  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClA-jNuyJKqN-xCm7KPG_XA">Monkey See, Monkey Do</a>
                  (former Code Monkey King) covering hobby programming projects,
                  and in two years the second one entirely dedicated to
                  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB9-prLkPwgvlKKqDgXhsMQ">chess programming</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The format of video programming tutorials was my preferred way of learning,
                  hence the desire to give something back to the community.
                  When I realized that the more I shared what I was currently learning on my own,
                  the more it benefited in return, I began to emphasize the didactic aspect of the content I was creating.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Eventually this has brought be to the path of freelancing,
                  but the classical way of how freelance is usually done,
                  like on specialized platform, e.g.
                  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01fa5b6769e04e40ba?viewMode=1">Upwork</a>,
                  has only served me as a starter point.
                  Since I always valued freedom above money and has been strongly disagreed that
                  the latter equals the former, instead of being competetive and trying to search
                  for a job I was making my YouTube content to serve as source of attracting potential
                  clients. This allowed me to choose and not to be chosen.
                <p>
                  The scope of my interests goes beyond programming and technologies.
                  For instance I practice <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQVmhF07TnM">Chinese Qigong</a>.
                  since 2006 to keep healthy and not being captivated by the unfortunate modern trends to sell one's internal
                  treasure for temporary benefits resulting in burnout followed by desolation.
                  Also I like to work by hands, e.g. 
                  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHZcld80L1w">welding</a>,
                  and make video about my
                  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEJypTex_kk&list=PLLfIBXQeu3aYBBDWAJGXBGPkkfuc_mYvG&index=10">daily life</a>
                  in style of art-house film making.
                </p>
                <p>Thank you for being here. I look forward to sharing and growing with you.</p>
